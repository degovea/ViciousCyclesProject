    Believe it or not, this company that we call Vicious Cycles started as nothing more then a running gag that 
    me and my fellow co-founders/close friends Thomas Franklin (far right) and Aaron Roca (far left) joked around about when we first started talking to each other whenever we where out and about together.
    We all met through cycling, and overtime had our bond of friendship and passion for cycling grew more and more by the days, and in the process as well
    the idea of actually starting a company that we could actually get behind if we were on the other side started to come into fruition. It was a gamble, but thanks to 
    at least one of use actually having some knowledge in the world of business (pointing to you Thomas), we decided to take that leap of faith together, and since then it 
    has been nothing but a journey to get to the point we are at know. I, Freddy Newman would have never ever gotten close to where I am  today if it 
    wasn't for Thomas and Aaron. Thanks to them, I am in a much better place mentally then I was before picking up cycling, and without them there would have never been
    a Vicious Cycles, just the idea of it and nothing more. We want that connection that we found within in both our friendships and bicycling to be reflected thoroughly with our companies mission, 
    and have those same experiences that we made along the way be recipricated back to our fellow customers with Vicious Cycles.
