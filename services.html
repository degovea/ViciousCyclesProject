<h1>Our Services</h1>
</header>
<p>We want to make sure that we have a impact in the community that our store is located in, and on of the many ways we make sure to have a impact is through the process of hosting events bi-weekly either in-store or somewhere near it. 
We don't just soley host cycle-related events, but also funraiser ones and and many more, to further get that reach that we want in the area we occupy. 
We also understand that while physical health is important, mental health is on par with physical health as well, and if one isn't working, then you won't be able to feel like your best you that you can be, that's why we also offer resources dedicated to that subject as well. 
More information about that can be found under the "Our Services" via our menu.
