<p>We want to make sure that we have a impact in the community that our store is located in, and one of the many ways we make surethat  impact goes through is by hosting bi-weekly events either in-store or somewhere near it. 
We don't just soley host cycle-related events though, but also funraiser ones and and many more as well. 
We also understand that while physical health is important, mental health is on par, if not more important then physical health so finding the balance
for both of those worlds is always beneficial for anyone, which is why we also offer resources dedicated to that subject as well. 
For more information regarding those subjects, click on the section "Our Services" via our menu to learn more.
