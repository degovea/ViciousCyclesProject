<img id="pic2" src="images/bike&sunset.jpg" alt="Cyclist admiring sunset"> After having a long day whatever it be from work, school, 
or anything else going in your life, finding that one activity to unwine and enjoy yourself either by your lonesome or with a group
can really take a lot of stress off from your shoulders. We here at Vicious Cycles understand the hurtles that come in life, that's why 
strive to make sure that you get the right gear for the right circumstance and situations that you want to take apart of. It doesn't matter
if you're just starting to pick up cycling, or have been cycling since the day you first started to walk, because here we help and treat 
all our customers with same respect as every other person. What matters most out of all of that, is that you are taking initiative to improve your
physical health by the use of biking.

Looking into getting some mountain gear for up-and-coming trip? How about maybe looking into getting a new crusier for whenever you're in the city?
Maybe getting a hybrid two mesh two worlds into one will suit your style and situation the best? All and more we have here at our Vicious Cycles
store located in Raleigh. Aside from having our store in a physical location, you can also browse around on our website as well with our Shop section,
so you can be sure that we have exactly what you're looking for. Sometimes we offer special discounts online only, so if you want to stay
in the know of that and more invloving our store and it's events, feel free to sign up via our contact form that can be found in the "Contact Us"

<img id="pic3" src="images/bikergroup.jpg" alt="group of cyclists riding together"> We want to make sure that we have a impact in the community that our store is located in, 
and on of the many ways we make sure to have a impact is through the process of hosting events bi-weekly either in-store or somewhere near it. We don't just soley host cycle-related events,
but also funraiser ones and and many more, to further get that reach that we want in the area we occupy. We also understand that while physical
health is important, mental health is on par with physical health as well, and if one isn't working, then you won't be able to feel like your 
best you that you can be, that's why we also offer resources dedicated to that subject as well. More information about that can be found under the "Our Services" via our menu.
